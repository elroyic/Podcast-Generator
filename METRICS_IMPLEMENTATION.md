## Prometheus Configuration

All services are configured in `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_interval: 15s  # Collect metrics every 15 seconds
evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'news-feed'
    metrics_path: '/metrics/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['news-feed:8001']
  
  - job_name: 'reviewer'
    metrics_path: '/metrics/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['reviewer:8008']
  
  # ... (all services configured)
```

**Status:** ✅ All services have metrics endpoints configured

---

## Docker Environment Variables

All services in `docker-compose.yml` now include:
- `WORKERS_ACTIVE=1` - Default worker count (can be scaled)
- For AI Overseer: `CELERY_WORKERS=1` - Celery worker count

**Worker Scaling:**
Workers can be scaled by:
1. Updating `WORKERS_ACTIVE` in docker-compose.yml
2. Restarting the service
3. For Presenter/Writer (CPU-intensive): Use `cpus: "5.0"` limit in compose file

---

## Grafana Dashboard Queries

Example PromQL queries for your key metrics:

### **Total Workers Across System**
```promql
sum(news_feed_workers_active + reviewer_workers_active + light_reviewer_workers_active + 
    heavy_reviewer_workers_active + overseer_workers_active + presenter_workers_active + 
    writer_workers_active + editor_workers_active + collections_workers_active + 
    publishing_workers_active)
```

### **Articles Per Hour**
```promql
news_feed_articles_per_hour
```

### **Total Reviews Per Hour**
```promql
sum(reviewer_light_total + reviewer_heavy_total + light_reviewer_reviews_per_hour + 
    heavy_reviewer_reviews_per_hour + presenter_reviews_per_hour + editor_scripts_per_hour)
```

### **Scripts Per Hour**
```promql
writer_scripts_per_hour
```

### **Service Health Overview**
```promql
up{job=~"news-feed|reviewer|ai-overseer|presenter|writer|editor|collections|publishing"}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Verify Metrics:**
   ```bash
   # Check each service
   curl http://localhost:8001/metrics/prometheus  # News Feed
   curl http://localhost:8013/metrics/prometheus  # Reviewer
   curl http://localhost:8004/metrics/prometheus  # Presenter
   # ... etc
   ```

3. **Access Prometheus:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:9090`
   - Query examples above

4. **Create Grafana Dashboard:**
   - Import the metrics
   - Create panels for: Workers Active, Articles/Hr, Reviews/Hr, Scripts/Hr
   - Set up alerts for worker failures or low throughput

---

## Configuration Reference

### Scaling Workers
To increase workers for a service, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
presenter:
  environment:
    - WORKERS_ACTIVE=5  # Scale to 5 workers
  cpus: "5.0"           # Allocate 5 CPUs
```

Then restart:
```bash
docker-compose up -d presenter
```

### Monitoring Worker Health
All services expose worker count at their `/metrics/prometheus` endpoint.
Prometheus scrapes these every 15 seconds.

---

## Compliance Check: ✅ 100% Aligned

Your implementation now **fully aligns** with the System Flow diagram requirements:

✅ All services have worker tracking  
✅ Articles/Hr metric implemented  
✅ Reviews/Hr metrics for all review stages  
✅ Scripts/Hr and Scripts/Day metrics  
✅ Collections status tracking  
✅ Publishing metrics  
✅ Prometheus monitoring configured  

The system is production-ready for metric monitoring and dashboard visualization.
