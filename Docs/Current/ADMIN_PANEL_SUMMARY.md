# Admin Panel Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive admin panel has been created to manage users and admin passwords in the Podcast AI system.

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Models (`shared/models.py`)
- **User Model**: New table for storing users with:
  - Username (unique)
  - Email (unique)
  - Hashed password (bcrypt)
  - Role (admin, editor, user)
  - Active status
  - Login tracking

### 2. API Schemas (`shared/schemas.py`)
- `UserBase`: Base user schema
- `UserCreate`: For creating new users
- `UserUpdate`: For updating user details
- `UserPasswordUpdate`: For changing passwords
- `User`: Full user schema with metadata

### 3. API Gateway Updates (`services/api-gateway/main.py`)

#### Authentication Enhancement
- Enhanced login to support database users
- Backward compatible with environment variable authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Last login tracking

#### New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/users` - List all users (admin only)
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user (admin only)
- `GET /api/users/{user_id}` - Get user details (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/{user_id}` - Update user (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/users/{user_id}` - Delete user (admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/me/password` - Change own password (authenticated users)

#### New Admin Panel Route
- `GET /admin-panel` - Admin panel UI

### 4. Admin Panel UI (`services/api-gateway/templates/admin-panel.html`)

#### Features
- **User Management Tab**:
  - View all users in a table
  - Add new users with role selection
  - Edit user details (email, role, active status)
  - Delete users (with self-protection)
  - View last login times

- **Change Password Tab**:
  - Change admin password securely
  - Current password verification
  - Password confirmation
  - Minimum 8 character requirement

#### UI Components
- Modal dialogs for add/edit operations
- Alert notifications for success/error messages
- Responsive table layout
- Color-coded role and status badges
- Consistent navigation with other pages

### 5. Navigation Updates
All admin panel pages now include "Admin" link:
- `dashboard.html`
- `groups.html`
- `episodes.html`
- `presenter-management.html`
- `news-feed-dashboard.html`
- `collections-dashboard.html`
- `reviewer-dashboard.html`
- `writers.html`
- `admin-panel.html`

### 6. Initialization Script (`init_admin_user.py`)
- Creates database tables
- Interactive admin user creation
- Password validation
- Checks for existing admin users

### 7. Documentation (`Docs/Current/Admin-Panel-Guide.md`)
Comprehensive guide covering:
- Features overview
- Getting started
- User roles
- Authentication methods
- User management procedures
- Password management
- API endpoints
- Security considerations

## How to Use

### First-Time Setup

1. **Initialize the database and create admin user**:
   ```bash
   python init_admin_user.py
   ```

2. **Start the services** (if using Docker):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the admin panel**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/login`
   - Login with the admin credentials you created
   - Click "Admin" in the navigation bar

### Managing Users

1. **Add User**:
   - Click "Add User" button
   - Fill in username, email, password, and role
   - Click "Add User" to create

2. **Edit User**:
   - Click "Edit" next to the user
   - Modify email, role, or active status
   - Click "Update User" to save

3. **Delete User**:
   - Click "Delete" next to the user
   - Confirm deletion
   - User is permanently removed

### Changing Password

1. Navigate to "Change Admin Password" tab
2. Enter current password
3. Enter new password (min 8 characters)
4. Confirm new password
5. Click "Update Password"

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with automatic salt generation
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
3. **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Editor, and User roles
4. **Self-Protection**: Cannot delete your own account
5. **Audit Logging**: User operations logged
6. **Unique Constraints**: Username and email must be unique

## User Roles

### Admin
- Full system access
- Can manage all users
- Can access admin panel
- Can create/edit/delete all content

### Editor
- Can create and edit content
- Cannot manage users
- Limited admin access

### User
- Read-only access
- Can view but not modify content

## Authentication Priority

1. **Database Users** (Primary): Users created via admin panel
2. **Environment Variables** (Fallback): `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Database authentication takes precedence over environment variables.

## Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'user',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

## API Examples

### Create User (Admin Only)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "newuser",
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

### Change Password
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/users/me/password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "current_password": "oldpassword",
    "new_password": "newpassword123"
  }'
```

### List Users (Admin Only)
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `services/api-gateway/templates/admin-panel.html`
- `init_admin_user.py`
- `Docs/Current/Admin-Panel-Guide.md`
- `ADMIN_PANEL_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified
- `shared/models.py` - Added User model
- `shared/schemas.py` - Added user schemas
- `services/api-gateway/main.py` - Added user management endpoints
- All HTML templates - Added Admin link to navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Create First Admin User**:
   ```bash
   python init_admin_user.py
   ```

2. **Test the Admin Panel**:
   - Log in with admin credentials
   - Create a test user
   - Try changing password
   - Test role-based access

3. **Production Considerations**:
   - Set strong `JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enforce stronger password requirements
   - Set up regular database backups
   - Configure proper logging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### "User not found" when trying to login
- Make sure you've run `init_admin_user.py`
- Check database connectivity
- Verify the users table exists

### "Authentication required" on admin panel
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check JWT token hasn't expired (24 hours)
- Verify user has "admin" role

### Cannot access admin panel
- Check navigation includes "Admin" link
- Verify route is registered in `main.py`
- Check server logs for errors

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `Docs/Current/Admin-Panel-Guide.md` for detailed instructions
2. Review server logs for errors
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Check JWT token validity

**Note**: This implementation provides a solid foundation for user management. Additional features can be added as needed, such as:
- Password reset via email
