# Next Steps - Post Implementation

**Status:** Critical Fixes Complete âœ…  
**Date:** September 30, 2025

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Optional)

Now that all critical fixes are implemented, here are recommended next steps:

### 1. Deploy and Test (Recommended)

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy
sleep 30

# Run validation test
/workspace/test_fixes_simple.sh

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### 2. Monitor System Performance

Set up basic monitoring to track:
- Episode generation success rate
- Average generation time
- Queue length
- Service health

### 3. Review Logs

```bash
# Check for any errors during startup
docker compose logs | grep -i error

# Monitor AI Overseer service
docker compose logs -f ai-overseer

# Monitor Editor service
docker compose logs -f editor
```

4. Wait for collection building
5. Trigger episode generation
6. Verify all steps (script, editor, audio, publish)
7. Check database records

**File:** `/workspace/tests/test_complete_workflow.py`

### C. Cadence Status UI

**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Improves visibility

**Features:**
- Display current cadence mode (Daily/3-Day/Weekly)

## Medium Priority (Month 1)

### 1. Presenter Brief Generation (1000-word briefs)

**Status:** Workflow mentions this but not implemented  
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

Add to `/workspace/services/ai-overseer/app/services.py`:
```python
async def generate_presenter_briefs(
    self,
    collection: Collection,
    presenters: List[Presenter]
) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Generate 1000-word briefs for each presenter."""
    # Implementation in ACTION_PLAN.md
```

### 2. External Publishing Platforms

**Status:** Only local publishing works  
**Effort:** 8-12 hours per platform

Platforms to integrate:
- Anchor.fm
- Libsyn
- Spotify for Podcasters
- RSS.com

### 3. Multi-Voice Presenter Sequencing

**Status:** Single combined output only  
**Effort:** 6-8 hours

Features:
- Turn-taking between presenters
- Voice interruptions
- Conversational flow

---

## Low Priority (Future)

### 1. OAuth2 Authentication

Replace basic JWT auth with OAuth2:
- Google Sign-In
- GitHub OAuth
- Custom OAuth provider

### 2. Auto-Scaling

Implement automatic scaling based on:
- Queue length
- Service load
- Time of day

### 3. Advanced Features

- Custom voice training
- Multi-language support
- Advanced content filtering
- A/B testing for scripts

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Review and update admin credentials
- [ ] Configure external storage volume
- [ ] Set up external database (optional)
- [ ] Configure backup strategy
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure domain and DNS

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy services to production environment
- [ ] Run health checks on all services
- [ ] Verify database migrations
- [ ] Test episode generation end-to-end
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure log aggregation

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Track performance metrics
- [ ] Verify scheduled tasks are running
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Document operational procedures

---

## Monitoring Metrics to Track

### Service Health
- Service uptime percentage
- Response time per endpoint
- Error rate by service
- Request throughput

### Episode Generation
- Episodes generated per day
- Average generation time
- Success vs. failure rate
- Queue length over time

### Content Quality
- Articles processed per day
- Review confidence distribution
- Editor improvement metrics
- Audio file sizes and durations

### Resource Usage
- CPU usage per service
- Memory usage per service
- Disk space usage
- Redis memory usage

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Episode generation fails with "Lock already acquired"
**Solution:** Wait for previous generation to complete (max 1 hour) or check for stuck locks in Redis

### Issue: Editor service timeouts
**Solution:** Increase editor service timeout or add more CPU resources

### Issue: Not enough articles for collection
**Solution:** Add more RSS feeds or lower MIN_FEEDS_PER_COLLECTION threshold

### Issue: Audio files not being created
**Solution:** Check Presenter service logs, verify VibeVoice model loaded correctly

### Issue: Duplicate episodes
**Solution:** Verify locking is working, check Redis connectivity

---

## Performance Tuning

### For High Volume (>10 episodes/day)

1. **Scale Reviewer Workers:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --scale light-reviewer=2
   ```

2. **Increase Ollama Resources:**
   ```yaml
   ollama:
     deploy:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpus: "8"
           memory: "16G"
   ```

3. **Add Database Indexes:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_articles_reviewer ON articles(reviewer_type, processed_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_episodes_status ON episodes(status, created_at);
   ```

### For Low Latency

1. **Enable Redis Caching:**
   - Cache frequently accessed podcast groups
   - Cache presenter and writer configurations

2. **Optimize Database Queries:**
   - Use connection pooling
   - Add appropriate indexes
   - Consider read replicas
