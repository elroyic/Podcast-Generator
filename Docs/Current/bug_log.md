# Bug Log - Podcast AI System Testing

## Testing Session: $(date)

### Issues Found:

#### 1. Service Configuration Issues
- [x] **CRITICAL: All services are not running** - Test shows 0/9 services healthy
- [x] Services not accessible at expected URLs (localhost:8000-8006, 8080)
- [x] **Docker not available** - Cannot use docker-compose to start services
- [x] **Missing system dependencies** - Python venv not available, pip restrictions
- [x] **Service dependencies missing**:
  - PostgreSQL database not running
  - Redis not running  
  - Ollama LLM service not running
- [ ] Check for missing dependencies
- [ ] Verify service URLs and ports
- [ ] Check database connectivity
- [ ] Validate environment variables

#### 2. API Endpoint Issues
- [x] **Health check endpoints** - All services have /health endpoints but not accessible
- [x] **Service communication** - Services use internal Docker networking (service:port)
- [x] **Data validation** - Pydantic schemas properly defined
- [x] **Error handling** - Proper HTTP exception handling in place
- [ ] Test individual service endpoints when running

#### 3. Database Issues
- [x] **Database configuration** - PostgreSQL configured in docker-compose.yml
- [x] **Table creation** - SQLAlchemy models properly defined with relationships
- [x] **Data persistence** - Models include proper foreign keys and constraints
- [x] **Query performance** - Basic queries look reasonable
- [ ] Test database connectivity when PostgreSQL is running

#### 4. Docker/Infrastructure Issues
- [x] **Container networking** - Services configured for Docker internal networking
- [x] **Volume mounting** - Proper volume mounts for storage, database, and Ollama data
- [x] **Service dependencies** - Health checks and depends_on properly configured
- [x] **Resource allocation** - GPU allocation for Ollama, proper memory limits
- [ ] **Docker not available** - Cannot test container deployment in current environment

#### 5. Integration Issues
- [x] **Service-to-service communication** - HTTP clients properly configured
- [x] **Data flow between services** - Clear service boundaries and data models
- [x] **Error propagation** - Proper error handling and logging
- [x] **Timeout handling** - Reasonable timeouts configured (30-300 seconds)
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow when services are running
