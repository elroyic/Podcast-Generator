# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and policies for the Podcast AI Generation system.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Admin dashboard protected with JWT tokens
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin role required for management operations
- **Token Expiration**: 24-hour token expiry with refresh capability

### 2. Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: All Docker images scanned with Trivy for vulnerabilities
- **Image Signing**: Images signed with Cosign for supply chain security
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials generated for all images
- **Minimal Base Images**: Services use minimal base images to reduce attack surface

### 3. Dependency Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Python dependencies scanned with Safety
- **Static Analysis**: Code scanned with Bandit and Semgrep
- **License Compliance**: Dependency licenses reviewed automatically
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly through automated PRs

### 4. Network Security
- **Service Isolation**: Services communicate through defined network boundaries
- **Internal Networks**: Inter-service communication on private Docker networks
- **Port Exposure**: Only necessary ports exposed to host
- **TLS Termination**: HTTPS termination at load balancer level

### 5. Data Security
- **Database Encryption**: PostgreSQL with encryption at rest
- **Redis Security**: Redis protected with authentication
- **File Storage**: Audio files stored with appropriate access controls
- **Backup Encryption**: Database backups encrypted

### 6. Operational Security
- **Health Checks**: All services include health monitoring
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for security monitoring
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Security Scanning Schedule

### Automated Scans
- **Daily**: Full security audit of all dependencies and containers
- **On Push**: Vulnerability scanning of changed services
- **On PR**: Dependency review for new/updated packages

### Manual Reviews
- **Monthly**: Security architecture review
- **Quarterly**: Penetration testing (if required)
- **Annually**: Full security audit

## Vulnerability Response

### Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts via CI/CD pipeline
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact within 4 hours
3. **Mitigation**: Deploy fixes within 24 hours
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders immediately

### High Vulnerabilities
1. **Detection**: Automated alerts via daily scans
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact within 2 business days
3. **Mitigation**: Deploy fixes within 1 week
4. **Communication**: Include in regular security reports

### Medium/Low Vulnerabilities
1. **Detection**: Weekly security reports
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate during next sprint planning
3. **Mitigation**: Include in regular maintenance cycles
4. **Communication**: Monthly security summary

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Default admin credentials for testing
- Relaxed authentication for development APIs
- Debug logging enabled

### Production
- Strong admin credentials required
- All management APIs require authentication
- Minimal logging for performance
- Security headers enforced

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- No personal data stored without consent
- Audio files can be deleted on request
- User data anonymized in logs

### Access Controls
- Admin access requires strong authentication
- Service-to-service communication authenticated
- Database access restricted to application services

## Security Contacts

- **Urgent**: Create GitHub security advisory
- **Internal**: Contact system administrator
